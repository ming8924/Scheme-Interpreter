<h3>Your assignment</h3>

<p>In this fourth piece of your programming project, you are assigned to
maintain and extend the micro-Scheme interpreter you've built in Assignments
<a href="http://www.cs.ust.hk/~dekai/151H/assignments/a1/html/">1</a>, <a
href="http://www.cs.ust.hk/~dekai/151H/assignments/a2/html/">2</a>, and <a
href="http://www.cs.ust.hk/~dekai/251/assignments/a3/html/">3</a>,
specifically to add function values (by supporting <tt>lambda</tt>) and
function application (by supporting standard Scheme expressions where the
first element of the list is any function value, as well as by supporting
explicit <tt>apply</tt> syntax).</p>

<p>For this assignment, we are giving you almost no new code. The tarball
a4.tar.gz contains exactly the same files as a3.tar.gz, except for (1) these
instructions and (2) a slightly extended <tt>cons.hpp</tt> interface, in
which we define an additional constructor <tt>lambda</tt>, along with a
corresponding type testing predicate <tt>procedurep</tt>, plus corresponding
accessors <tt>get_formals</tt> and <tt>get_body</tt>, and (3) a skeleton
<tt>library.scm</tt> file that we'll describe in Step 3 below.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Support lambda, to construct anonymous function values</h3>

<p>A function is just another kind of value, like int, double, symbol,
or cons values.  It must be possible to pass function values as
parameters and return values, and so forth.</p>

<p>To make a function value, we need a constructor that constructs a
<tt>ProcedureCell</tt> holding the newly constructed function value.
You might think this constructor should be called <tt>make_procedure</tt>
(like <tt>make_int</tt> or <tt>make_symbol</tt>), but the historical
convention is to call this constructor <tt>lambda</tt> instead. (This is
analogous to the fact that <tt>cons</tt> is also really a constructor
that you might think should have been called <tt>make_cons</tt> instead.)</p>

<p>So you will add a new operator to your implementation, <tt>lambda</tt>,
that allows construction of anonymous functions of zero or more arguments,
as discussed in lecture:</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (lambda (x y z) (* x y z))<br />
#&lt;function&gt;<br />
&gt; (define multiply (lambda (x y z) (* x y z)))<br />
()<br />
&gt; (define multiply-tracing (lambda (x y z) (print (quote multiplying..))
(* x y z)))<br />
()</tt></p>

<p>When a <tt>lambda</tt> expression is evaluated, it should cause the
<tt>lambda</tt> constructor in the newly extended <tt>cons.hpp</tt> interface
to be called in order to construct a new <tt>ProcedureCell</tt> holding the
new function value. (Remember, think of the <tt>lambda</tt> constructor just
as if it were instead called <tt>make_procedure</tt>.)</p>

<p>The behavior of <tt>lambda</tt> should exactly conform to <a
href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">Scheme
R5RS</a>, as described in lecture. It requires two or more
operands. The first operand must be a list of symbols (for instance
<tt>(x y z)</tt> in the above example), which describes the formal
parameters of the function.  The rest of the operands must be a
sequence of expressions, describing the body of the function.</p>

<p>You should store the list of arguments in the <tt>formals</tt> field of the
<tt>ProcedureCell</tt>. You should store the list of expressions in the body
(for instance <tt>((print (quote multiplying..)) (* x y z))</tt> in the above
example) in the <tt>body</tt> field of the <tt>ProcedureCell</tt>.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Support function application</h3>

<p>You are now in a position to add the ability to apply the functions,
whether anonymous or named. You should support both the normal Scheme syntax
where the first element of the list is a function value, as well as explicit
<tt>apply</tt> syntax:</p>

<p><tt>&gt; ((lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 2 3)<br />
5<br />
&gt; (multiply 2 3 4)<br />
24<br />
&gt; (multiply-tracing 2 3 4)<br />
multiplying..<br />
24<br />
&gt; (apply multiply (quote (2 3 4)))<br />
24<br />
&gt; (define apply-to-2-3-4 (lambda (f) (apply f (quote (2 3 4)))))<br />
()<br />
&gt; (apply-to-2-3-4 multiply)<br />
24<br />
&gt; ((quote multiply) 2 3 4)<br />
ERROR: cannot apply a value that is not a function<br />
&gt; (apply (quote multiply) (quote 2 3 4))<br />
ERROR: cannot apply a value that is not a function<br />
&gt; (apply-to-2-3-4 (quote multiply))<br />
ERROR: cannot apply a value that is not a function</tt></p>

<p>To accomplish this, you'll want to implement an additional virtual
function <tt>apply()</tt> for <tt>Cell</tt> and its derived classes. In
particular, the real work of applying a function should be done by <tt>Cell*
ProcedureCell::apply(Cell* const args)</tt> where <tt>this</tt> points to a
<tt>ProcedureCell</tt> holding the function to be applied, and <tt>args</tt>
points to a list of values to be supplied as the arguments the function is
being called with. You can then use your <tt>apply()</tt> to support both the
normal Scheme syntax where the first element of the list is a function value,
as well as the explicit <tt>apply</tt> syntax.</p>

<p><em>All</em> expressions in the body must be eagerly evaluated, in
left-to-right order. This guarantees that the program:</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (define foo (lambda () (print (quote Hello)) (print (quote
world)) (print (quote !!))))<br />
()<br />
&gt; (foo)<br />
Hello<br />
world<br />
!!<br />
()</tt></p>

<p>will print out the desired words in order. (Also notice that in this
example, the lambda expression constructs a function that takes zero
arguments.)</p>

<p>Similarly, <em>all</em> expressions in the argument list must be eagerly
evaluated (but we leave the order of evaluation unspecified; that's your
choice).</p>

<p><em>Hint: Distinguish local versus global scope!</em> When you apply a
lambda (i.e., apply a function), the parameter names become local variable
names. When you are doing symbol name lookup, you need to make sure that
local scope takes priority over global scope. First try to find the symbol
name in the local symbol table; only if that fails, then try to find it in
the global symbol table. For example:</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (define z 3)<br />
()<br />
&gt; ((lambda (x) (+ x z)) 2)<br />
5<br />
&gt; (define x 4)<br />
()<br />
&gt; ((lambda (x) (+ x z)) 2)<br />
5</tt></p>

<p>Unlike in Assignment 3, you can no longer get away with just a single
global symbol table. Since functions can call functions which can call
functions (or even call recursively for an unbounded number of recursions),
you will need a <em>stack</em> of symbol tables to keep proper track of
<em>local</em> symbol tables. Consider, for example, the following
<tt>factorial</tt> function that takes a single operand <em>n</em> of type
<tt>int</tt>, and returns <em>n</em>! which is also of type <tt>int</tt>:</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (define factorial (lambda (x) (if (&lt; x 2) 1 (* x (factorial (-
x 1))))))<br />
()<br />
&gt; (factorial 1)<br />
1<br />
&gt; (factorial 4)<br />
24<br />
&gt; (factorial 10)<br />
3628800</tt></p>

<p>Whenever <tt>factorial</tt> is called, there is a new local variable
<tt>x</tt> that must not be confused with either the global variable
<tt>x</tt> or any other instances of local variables named <tt>x</tt>. For
instance, <tt>(factorial 4)</tt> has a local variable <tt>x</tt> bound to 4,
but when it calls <tt>(factorial 3)</tt> there will be a new local variable
<tt>x</tt> bound to 3 that must not be confused with the local variable
<tt>x</tt> associated with <tt>(factorial 4)</tt>.</p>

<p>So to avoid that kind of confusion, every time a function is called, a new
local symbol table must be pushed on the stack, containing all the parameter
symbol names as the local variables for that function. Whenever execution of
a function is finished, its local symbol table must be popped from the
stack.</p>

<p>Remember to review the examples in Assignments 1, 2, and 3 and make sure
everything still works.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Start implementing library functions using your own Scheme (not
C++)</h3>

<p>Congratulations!!</p>

<p>You have now implemented your own fully <strong>Turing-equivalent</strong>
programming language. In principle, you can now program anything using your
micro-Scheme interpreter, and never have to use C++ again! More precisely, as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-complete">Wikipedia</a> puts it:
<em>In computability theory, an abstract machine or programming language is
called Turing complete, Turing equivalent, or (computationally) universal if
it has a computational power equivalent to (i.e., capable of emulating) a
simplified model of a programmable computer known as the universal Turing
machine. Being equivalent to the universal Turing machine essentially means
being able to perform any computational task &ndash; though it does not mean
being able to perform such tasks efficiently, quickly, or easily... The term
derives from the name of mathematician Alan Turing who introduced the model
of the universal Turing machine.</em></p>

<p>This means that from now on, you can implement the rest of your
micro-Scheme programming language, using <em>only</em> micro-Scheme. We have
used C++ to <strong>bootstrap</strong> your implementation of the
micro-Scheme programming language, and the rest can be done in micro-Scheme
itself. You don't have to use C++ any more (well, maybe for a few special
purpose convenience items). Hurrah! COMP151H is almost over, and we can start
learning other interesting languages besides C++.</p>

<p>You'll celebrate by using your interpreter to start implementing
general-purpose library functions <strong>using your micro-Scheme
language</strong> (not using C++). For example, the <tt>factorial</tt>
function above is actually a real function in the standard Scheme
specification, which you see you can implement in your own micro-Scheme
instead of using C++. Similarly, the operators <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>,
<tt>&gt;=</tt>, <tt>=</tt>, and <tt>abs</tt> are all general-purpose library
functions that you can implement as follows using your micro-Scheme language
rather than C++, as follows (for simplicity, we're providing just the
versions that take exactly two operands):</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (define &gt; (lambda (x y) (&lt; y x)))<br />
()<br />
&gt; (&gt; 2 5)<br />
0<br />
&gt; (define &gt;= (lambda (x y) (not (&lt; x y))))<br />
()<br />
&gt; (&lt;= 3 2)<br />
0<br />
&gt; (define &lt;= (lambda (x y) (not (&lt; y x))))<br />
()<br />
&gt; (&lt;= 3 3)<br />
1<br />
&gt; (define = (lambda (x y) (if (&lt; x y) 0 (not (&lt; y x)))))<br />
()<br />
&gt; (= 2 2)<br />
1<br />
&gt; (= 2 3)<br />
0<br />
&gt; (= 3 2)<br />
0<br />
&gt; (define abs (lambda (x) (if (&lt; x 0) (- 0 x) x)))<br />
()<br />
&gt; (abs 3)<br />
3<br />
&gt; (abs -3)<br />
3</tt></p>

<p>Are you getting the hang of it yet?</p>

<p>The required additional library function you will implement is
<tt>for-each</tt>, which does something kind of similar to the STL
<tt>for_each</tt> generic algorithm for C++ that we studied in lecture.</p>

<p>Your <tt>for-each</tt> function should take two operands, where the first
operand must be a function of one argument, and the second operand must be a
list. It should apply the function to every element in the list. The return
value of <tt>for-each</tt> is unspecified (so you could return <tt>()</tt>,
for example).</p>

<p><tt>(for-each</tt> <em>&lt;function&gt; &lt;list&gt;</em><tt>)</tt> </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (define square (lambda (x) (print (* x x))))<br />
()<br />
&gt; (for-each square (quote (2 5 9 14 256)))<br />
4<br />
25<br />
81<br />
196<br />
65536<br />
()</tt></p>

<p>You can also consult <a
href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">Scheme R5RS</a> for
details of <tt>for-each</tt>.</p>

<p>Please feel free to implement any other general-purpose library functions
you would like, just for fun. Some suggestions: the general <tt>map</tt> and
<tt>reduce</tt> functions and the <tt>list</tt> function. These require you
to have implemented the optional bonus support for a variable number of
formal parameters for <tt>lambda</tt>, as described below.</p>

<p>When you are finished, add <strong>all</strong> your Scheme library
functions to the <tt>library.scm</tt> file where we've already placed the
libary functions <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>, <tt>&gt;=</tt>, <tt>=</tt>,
<tt>abs</tt> and <tt>factorial</tt> to get you started. Make sure your
improved version of <tt>library.scm</tt> is included in your tarball
submission.</p>

<h3>Optional bonus: Support a variable number of arguments</h3>

<p>The following is purely for fun. You are <em>not</em> required to do it!
Only try this if you are bored or want to impress me :-)</p>

<p>If you wish, you may also implement Scheme's support for variable number
of arguments.</p>

<p><tt>&gt; (define first (lambda args (car args)))<br />
&gt; (first (quote a) (quote b) (quote c))<br />
a<br />
&gt; (first (quote a) (quote b) (quote c) (quote d) (quote e) (quote f))<br />
a</tt></p>

<p>The key here is that <tt>args</tt> is a symbol rather than a list of
symbols. You can consult <a
href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">Scheme R5RS</a> for
more details.</p>

<p>If you do this optional bonus, then notice it will also let you implement
the general version of the <tt>for-each</tt> function as defined in <a
href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">Scheme R5RS</a> so
that the first operand can be a function that takes any number of
operands:</p>

<p><tt>(for-each</tt> <em>&lt;function&gt; &lt;list1&gt; &lt;list2&gt;
...</em><tt>)</tt> </p>

<p>Definitely don't try this unless you have everything else in this
assignment perfectly done!</p>

<h3>Optional bonus: Support the `<tt>let</tt>' syntactic sugar</h3>

<p>If you are finished with all the optional bonuses so far, you can try
this. Again, the following is purely for fun, and you are <em>not</em>
expected to do it unless you want to.</p>

<p>You may also wish to implement Scheme's support for the <tt>let</tt>
syntactic sugar for <tt>lambda</tt>. This can make programming with local
variables much more convenient and readable. You can also consult <a
href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">Scheme R5RS</a> for
more details.</p>

<p>The <tt>let</tt> syntax is an alternate syntax for lambda expressions,
that more closely resembles local (const) variable definitions in other
languages you're familiar with, like C++. For example, the following two
expressions have identical meaning:</p>

<p><tt>&gt; ((lambda (x y) (* x y)) 2 3)<br />
6<br />
&gt; (let ((x 2) (y 3)) (* x y))<br />
6</tt></p>

<p>If we rewrite the latter expression with better indentation, it looks like
this:</p>

<p><tt>(let ((x 2)<br />
      (y 3))<br />
  (* x y))<br />
</tt></p>

<p>which looks much like the roughly equivalent C++ code:</p>

<p><tt>{<br />
  int x(2);<br />
  int y(3);<br />
  return x * y;<br />
}<br />
</tt></p>

<p>So in fact, <tt>lambda</tt> not only implements functions, but also
implements local variables!</p>

<h3>Putting it all together and testing your implementation</h3>

<p>Except for the modified version of <tt>cons.hpp</tt> and the new
<tt>library.scm</tt>, all other source files in <tt>a4.tar.gz</tt> are
identical to those from <tt>a3.tar.gz</tt>.</p>

<p>So you should start from your Assignment 3 implementation and extend it,
replacing only the old <tt>cons.hpp</tt> with the new one. Be careful! You
still may not break any of the encapsulation rules from Assignment 3.</p>
<!--
<p>The a4.tar.gz tarball contains many development test cases to help
you with testing your implementation.  They are broken into three
categories: easy cases (<tt>testinput.dev.easy.txt</tt>), general cases
(<tt>testinput.dev.general.txt</tt>, and exception cases
(<tt>testinput.dev.exception.txt</tt>). All the correct outputs are also
given to you for both the easy cases (<tt>testinput.dev.easy.ref.txt</tt>)
and the general cases (<tt>testinput.dev.general.ref.txt</tt>).</p>

<p>Your submitted implementation will be graded using a similar (but
different) set of test cases.</p>

<p>In addition, the tarball contains the binary executable of a reference
solution (compiled for the Linux lab machines you are supposed to
be using).  You can run this program to see the possible behavior
of a correct solution.  (Note that your implementation might give
different results for some error cases, because for all operators
other than <tt>if</tt>, we have deliberately avoided specifying what
order the operands are evaluated and checked.  This could lead to
different errors being discovered first, causing evaluation to be
prematurely aborted when the exception is thrown.)</p>
-->

<p>Remember again, the objective of this programming project is for you to
train your skills, by practicing correct software engineering techniques
enabling you to build, maintain, and extend a non-trivial piece of
well-engineered code.</p>

<h3>Important reminders</h3>

<p>You must follow the design approach outlined in this document. Do
<em>not</em> just implement the required functionality using a different
design.</p>

<p>This time you <em>must</em> use templates. In this assignment, you are
expected to make good use of the STL <tt>map</tt> - but neatly, without
messing up the polymorphic approach you built in Assignment 2.</p>

<p>Remember we are focusing on proper use of encapsulation. So you still
should <em>not</em> edit the files <tt>parse.hpp</tt>, <tt>parse.cpp</tt>,
<tt>cons.hpp</tt>, <tt>eval.hpp</tt>, or <tt>main.cpp</tt>. Again, the
programming assignments are mini-exercises in how multiple programmers are
supposed to interact and communicate in the real world; these files are
<em>owned</em> and <em>maintained</em> by the other author(s).</p>

<p>The tarball you turn in will need to contain your new or extended
implementations of <tt>eval.cpp</tt>, <tt>Cell.hpp</tt>, <tt>Cell.cpp</tt>,
and <tt>library.scm</tt>.</p>

<p>Depending on your approach, you may or may not need to change the
<tt>Makefile</tt>. Whether you changed it or not, always make sure you
include whatever <tt>Makefile</tt> is needed to build your program, when you
submit assignment. Otherwise, the graders cannot build your program.</p>

<p>You must write the final version of the program on your own. Sophisticated
plagiarism detection systems are in operation, and they are pretty good at
catching copying! If you worked in study groups, you must also acknowledge
your collaborators in the write-up for each problem, whether or not they are
classmates. Other cases will be dealt with as plagiarism. Re-read the policy
on the course home page, and note the University's tougher policy this year
regarding cheating.</p>

<p><strong>Your programming style (how clearly and how well you speak C++) is
what will be graded. Correct functioning of your program is necessary but not
sufficient!</strong></p>
